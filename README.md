🏢 Customer Churn Prediction — Enterprise Edition

Live Demo :- https://customer-churn-prediction-enterprise-edition.streamlit.app/

Decision Tree Regressor–powered SaaS retention intelligence platform with advanced CRM telemetry, revenue exposure simulation, and Monte Carlo cohort variance modeling.

🚀 Overview
This project is a production-style Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard built using:

🌳 Decision Tree Regressor
📊 Advanced CRM Feature Telemetry
📈 Revenue Impact Simulation
🎲 Monte Carlo Cohort Risk Modeling
🧾 Exportable JSON & CSV Dossiers
🎨 Enterprise Obsidian UI Theme

The system predicts churn probability (%) and translates it into:
Business risk classification
Revenue exposure forecasting
Customer risk topology visualization
Financial impact simulation
Exportable retention reports
